# MooseX::DBIC::Scaffold

Generate DBIx::Class classes using Moose

MooseX::DBIC::Scaffold creates a scaffold of code for [DBIx::Class](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBIx::Class) using a schema
object from [SQL::Translator](http://github.com/arcanez/SQL-Translator).

Currently the version of SQL::Translator required is not available on CPAN and must be
fetched directly from github http://github.com/arcanez/SQL-Translator

There are many other scaffold generators around. MooseX::DBIC::Scaffold attempts
to bring some of the best features from those along with some new features.

## Features

  * All generated code is in a single file
  * Generated code is in a predicatable order, so diffs are easily readable
  * Separation between generated code and user written code
  * User code is written as [Moose::Role](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Moose::Role) classes
  * Complete control over class and relationship names
  * Ability to have class model exclude any table, column or relationship
